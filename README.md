# KMeans-Clustering-on-Iris-Dataset
this project demonstrates the application of KMeans clustering on the Iris dataset, specifically focusing on sepal length and sepal width. The goal is to identify and visualize clusters within the dataset, first using the raw data and then using standardized data to improve clustering accuracy.
