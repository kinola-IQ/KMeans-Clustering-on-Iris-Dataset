This repository contains code to perform KMeans clustering on the Iris dataset, focusing on sepal length and sepal width. The aim is to identify and visualize clusters within the dataset, initially using the raw data and subsequently using standardized data for improved clustering accuracy.

Steps and Significance
1. Importing Libraries
The essential libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and clustering are imported. pandas is used for data handling, matplotlib.pyplot for plotting, KMeans from sklearn for clustering, and preprocessing from sklearn for standardizing the data.

2. Loading the Dataset
The Iris dataset is loaded from a CSV file into a DataFrame. This dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of Iris flowers.

3. Clustering Based on Sepal Shape
Columns related to sepal measurements (sepal_length and sepal_width) are extracted for clustering.

4. Performing Initial KMeans Clustering
KMeans clustering is performed with an arbitrary choice of 2 clusters. The data is fitted, and cluster IDs are assigned to each data point.

5. Visualizing Initial Clusters
The clusters are visualized by plotting sepal length against sepal width, with different colors representing different clusters.

6. Standardizing the Data
To account for unequal weighting of features, the data is standardized (mean = 0, variance = 1).

7. Determining Optimal Number of Clusters using Elbow Method
The Elbow Method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters. The Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) is calculated for different numbers of clusters (1 to 9), and the results are plotted. The "elbow" point on the plot suggests the optimal number of clusters.

8. Performing KMeans Clustering with Optimal Number of Clusters
Based on the Elbow Method, the optimal number of clusters is chosen (3 in this case), and KMeans clustering is performed again using the standardized data.

9. Visualizing the New Clusters
The new clusters are visualized, showing improved clustering accuracy due to standardization.

Conclusion
This code demonstrates clustering the Iris dataset based on sepal measurements using KMeans. Initial clustering is performed on raw data, followed by standardizing the data to improve clustering accuracy. The Elbow Method helps determine the optimal number of clusters, leading to better-defined clusters in the standardized data.
